We provide a service that aims to create a community for ASM to work safely and in a stable environment. Through our system ASM will have the opportunity to inform Barrick of a potential opportunity via a picture containing geographic location. If it is indeed an opportunity, Barrick will be in a position to fund and employ said ASM once training and vetting requirement are satisfied.",
